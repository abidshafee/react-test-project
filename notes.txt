Start react project in current directory
>> npn react-create-app ./
[i.e]: E:\Development Projects\react-test-project>npn react-create-app ./
----------------------------------******------------------------------------
Success! Created react-test-project at E:\Development Projects\react-test-project
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd E:\Development Projects\react-test-project
  npm start

Happy hacking!
